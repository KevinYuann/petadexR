\title{Initialize Colony Data from File}
\usage{
initialize_colony_data(path_name, image_obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_name}{\code{character(1)}. Path to the TSV file containing colony data.
The file may contain comment lines starting with "#" at the beginning.}

\item{image_obj}{\code{cimg}. Image object from the imager package (currently
unused but included for potential future functionality).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing the colony data from the file with the
first column renamed to "row" and comment lines properly skipped.
}
\description{
Reads colony data from a tab-separated values (TSV) file, automatically
skipping comment lines that start with "#" and properly formatting the
first column as "row". The function handles files with variable numbers
of header comment lines.
}
\details{
The coordinates in the input file are assumed to already be in the top-left
origin coordinate system, so no coordinate transformation is performed.
}
