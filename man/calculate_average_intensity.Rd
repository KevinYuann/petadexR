\title{Calculate Average Pixel Intensity in Bounding Boxes}
\usage{
calculate_average_intensity(img, colony_data, prefix = "bg")
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{\code{cimg}. Image object from the imager package, typically loaded
with \code{load.image()} or created with other imager functions.}

\item{colony_data}{\code{data.frame}. Colony data with bounding box coordinates
(new_xl, new_xr, new_yt, new_yb) created by \code{create_grid_boxes()}.}

\item{prefix}{\code{character(1)}. Prefix to add to the new intensity columns.
Default is "bg" (background).}
}
\value{
A \code{data.frame} containing the original colony data plus three new
columns with the specified prefix: mean_intensity, median_intensity, and
sd_intensity, containing the statistical measures of pixel intensity
within each bounding box.
}
\description{
For each bounding box defined by coordinates (new_xl, new_xr, new_yt, new_yb),
calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of pixel intensities within
that area using the imager package for efficient computation.
}
\details{
Requires \code{create_grid_boxes()} to be called first to establish
bounding box coordinates.

Outputs a warning message if there are no pixels within the bounding box
created
}
