\title{Classify Pixels by Colony Bounding Box}
\usage{
classify_pixels(img, colony_data_with_bg, background_normalization)
}
\arguments{
\item{img}{\code{cimg}. Image object loaded by \code{imager::load.image()}.}

\item{colony_data_with_bg}{\code{data.frame}. Colony data that includes background
intensity statistics (bg_median_intensity, bg_sd_intensity) from
\code{calculate_average_intensity()}.}

\item{background_normalization}{\code{numeric(1)}. Value to add to all pixel
intensities for normalization purposes. Calculated by
\code{edge_intensity_difference()$difference}.}
}
\value{
A \code{list} containing three elements:
\itemize{
\item \code{classified_data}: Image data frame with added \code{label} and \code{colony_id} columns
\item \code{colony_summary}: Summary statistics for each colony including pixel counts and percentages
\item \code{total_stats}: Overall statistics across all colonies
}
}
\description{
Classifies pixels within each colony's bounding box as "clearing", "background",
or "halo" based on intensity thresholds derived from each individual box's background statistics.
Uses median Â± 4 standard deviations as classification thresholds. Requires
colony data with background intensity statistics.
