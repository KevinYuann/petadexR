Description:
    Plastics degrade into micro‑ and nanoplastics (MNPs) that bioaccumulate in
    ecosystems and human tissues. PETadexR unites     petabase‑scale computational
    biology with high‑throughput functional genomics to discover and characterize
    novel plastic‑degrading enzymes (PETases) with superior kinetics, stability,
    and low‑toxicity byproducts.
